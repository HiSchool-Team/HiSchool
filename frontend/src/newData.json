    "description": "Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is the British wizarding school, located in the Scottish Highlands. It accepts magical students from Great Britain and Ireland for enrollment. It is a state-owned school funded by the Ministry of Magic. The precise location of the school can never be uncovered because it was rendered Unplottable. To Muggles, the school looks like an old abandoned castle. Similarly, most wizarding schools locations are protected in order to prevent their ways of teaching being revealed, as well as protect the students and schools themselves from any harm.",
